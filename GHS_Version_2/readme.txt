This is the second version of my functional area for GHS

it contains a place holder GIS for the sake of testing microservices

it also contains the Eureka server

both GHS and GIS package have Eureka Client dependencies

NOTE:
You DON'T have to add eureka client in your package, 
it works independently and it's not NECESSARY

You can always hard code the URL to transfer stuffs.
