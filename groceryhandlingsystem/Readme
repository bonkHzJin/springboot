Sprint 1

Documentations:

local host port changed to 8089
	- reasoning : it's occupied by Jenkins, and I don't know how to close it.
 
using MySQL DB with local host with:
	- MySQL server 
	- MySQL workbench 8.0.31 instead of the latest
		- because it will crash on MacOS with m1 chip on Ventura 13.2.1
		
Dependencies:
	- although can be seen in pom.xml, I'm still going to list it here since it's simplified and easy to understand;
		- Spring Web 		// for obvious reason
		- Spring DevTool 	// automatically restarts the program when ever we hit save
		- Spring DATA JPA 	// for Repository Functions like save(), findById(), deleteById(), @Autowired etc.
		- Lombok 			// java library + Lombok annotations, such as turning things in to Entity etc.
		- MySQL Driver 		// Cuz I'm using MySQL
		- Thymeleaf 		// for the front end, make it look nicer.
		
Data Source && settings on how to connect to the MySQL is in the application.properties
